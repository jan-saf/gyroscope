# Sensor smartphone app

Simple app streaming sensor data over websocket.

Why the name `gyroscope` of this repository? The original idea was to use only gyroscope, but then I have added an accelerometer as well, but the name remained the same.

The easiest way to run this project is to set up flutter tool on your machine, connect your smartphone and run
```
flutter run
```
